# ⛽ Fuel Price Prediction System

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **Machine Learning-based Fuel Price Prediction System** that forecasts future fuel prices using historical data. It uses **time series forecasting (Prophet)** and exposes predictions through a **FastAPI backend**, with a simple **HTML + JavaScript frontend** for visualization.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/JashwanthDomala/Fule_prediction.git
cd Fule_prediction
```

---

### 2. Install Dependencies

```
pip install pandas prophet fastapi uvicorn scikit-learn
```

---

### 3. Run Backend Server

```
cd Backend
python -m uvicorn api:app --reload
```

---

### 4. Run Frontend

* Open `index.html` in browser

---

## 🌐 API Endpoints

## 📊 Model Details

* Model Used: **Facebook Prophet**
* Type: Time Series Forecasting
* Input: Historical fuel prices
* Output: Future predicted prices

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

* MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
* RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Data is cleaned and converted into time series format
2. Prophet model is trained on historical data
3. Future dates are generated
4. Predictions are returned via API
5. Frontend visualizes results using charts

## 🎯 Future Improvements

* Support multiple fuel types (diesel, petrol, etc.)
* Deploy online (Render / AWS)
* Add better UI (React)
* Improve model accuracy
